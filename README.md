# [projare](https://projare.herokuapp.com)

A sample web application using a backend built on [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) with [Phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix) and a frontend
with [riotjs](http://riotjs.com/).

This is a small experiment to build a minimal but more or less complete
web application using the above technologies.

I was too lazy to write tests, but all features should be functional.

The project is MIT licensed, so feel free to borrow parts here if you want to.
